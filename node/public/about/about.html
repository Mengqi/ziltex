  <h3>Who are you?</h3>
  <ul>
    I am Mengqi Zong, currently working as a software engineer in San Francisco
    Bay Area. Before joining the industry, I studied at Columbia University
    in Machine Learning as a master student. I also worked on online
    gaming data compression algorithms using Artificial Intelligence for
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/9you-www.9you.com-">9YOU</a>
    when I was a junior in college. And I got paid for the new algorithm I
    designed and that was my first job. Because of my strong interest in
    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I used to want to get
    myself a PhD in Machine Learning. But then I realized that PhD
    actually did not fit in my interest in the long run. But... I used
    to be a <a href="http://www.wowpedia.org/Shadow_Dance">ShD</a>.

  <h3>What does ZILTEX stand for?</h3>
  <ul>
    It means "my plain-text website". I used to lurk on the Internet as
    "Zil", so "ZIL" stands for me. As to "TEX", it comes from the idea
    that most of the content in this site is in plain text.
  </ul>
  <h3>Where did all this start?</h3>
  <ul>
    I was watching a techtalk of Linus Torvalds on git. And I found one of
    his comments on log system was quite inspiring (The quote above). Later
    on, having experienced some other things, I realized that how sad it was
    to barely remember anything about my past - neither the good ones nor the
    bad ones. So I made up my mind to set up my own "log system" to record
    what I have been thinking about. Also, it's interesting to learn how to
    set up a web site.

  <h3>Tell me something more about you?</h3>

    I am a big fan of <a href="http://youtu.be/penvn9VL32Y">Modest Mouse</a>.
